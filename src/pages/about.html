  <h3 id="i-like-to-build">I LIKE TO BUILD</h3>
  <p>I’m a web developer who really likes to build websites. It’s a pretty good coincidence. My focus right now is trying to improve with CSS. <strong>I believe CSS is the future toolbox</strong>  of web designers and will be  <strong>the most important web development skill</strong>  moving forwards. Time to move those boxes.</p>

  <h3 id="i-work-at-bineo">I WORK AT BINEO 🚀</h3>
  <p>I joined  <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>  as an early stage employee and then went on an exciting journey to Google where I’ve still been on the Firebase team for over 7 years. I’m a Developer Relations Engineer. That’s a fancy way of saying I work on tooling, content, docs, and product launches. I have done  <strong>a lot</strong>  of YouTube videos for  [Firebase].</p>
  <h3 id="im-32-years-old">I’M {{ age }} YEARS OLD 👴🏼</h3>
  <p>I look young and the older I get the nicer it is. I don’t two kids and I can’t count the amount of times people have asked me if I’m their brother or babysitter. I promise I have a mouth and a whole other lower part of my face. I made a decision that this was a part of the art direction of the site, so I’m stuck with it now.</p>
  <h3 id="here-are-my-dogs-rica-choco-and-toby">HERE ARE MY DOGS 🐶: RICA, CHOCO AND TOBY</h3>

  <p>These dogs are a majestic creature. Choco likes ear rubs and cheese. Rica likes to play with Choco and Toby becomes obsessed with the toys they play fetch with. When you stop and think about it, who doesn’t? Yes, they are my dog.</p>

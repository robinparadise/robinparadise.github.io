# Play with CSS3

With this infinite animation, I just want to show what CSS is now capable of. The transition is a mix of three animation: the first one, it's called Lightspeed; the second one is a Flip; and the last one, it's called Hinge. Clarify that most of these animations will only work in the very latest versions of web browsers.
